## Introduction

The RBAC UI is an integral component for managing security configurations in dynamic and sensitive environments. Designed with scalability and customization in mind, it offers precise control over access permissions, tailored to the specific roles within an organization.

## System Architecture

The system's architecture is modular, designed to enhance security through separation of concerns:

- **Admin Module**: Centralized control for system settings and audit trails.
- **Backend Module**: Secure API endpoints manage the data transactions and enforce access controls.
- **Frontend Module**: Interactive interface that allows seamless management of users and permissions by system administrators.

## Advanced Features

- **Dynamic Access Control**: System administrators can configure access permissions in real-time without needing to restart the system or disrupt ongoing operations.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging mechanisms record every action, providing traceability and supporting compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Leveraging WebSocket technology for push-based updates, ensuring that all data across the platform remains consistent and current without manual refreshes.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: Utilizes React's component-based architecture for efficient UI construction and state management.
- **Redux**: Manages application state globally, enhancing the consistency and predictability of the UI's behavior.
- **Styled-Components**: Facilitates scoped CSS management, promoting styling consistency and reducing style conflicts.

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express**: Offers a lightweight, efficient server capable of handling numerous simultaneous connections with low overhead.
- **MongoDB**: Provides a NoSQL database solution that excels in handling large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Implements token-based authentication to secure communications between the client and the server.

### DevOps
- **Docker**: Containerization ensures that the application runs consistently across all deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD pipelines, reducing the potential for human error and speeding up development cycles.

## Detailed Project Structure

The project is divided into distinct modules, each with a specific role:

- **`admin/`**: Houses the dashboard logic and interface components for system configuration.
- **`backend/`**: Contains all server-side logic, database interaction, and security enforcement.
- **`frontend/`**: Implements the client-facing application, handling user interactions and data presentation.

## Core Functionalities

- **User Management**: Comprehensive tools for managing user profiles, with functionalities for adding, editing, and deactivating accounts.
- **Role Management**: Customizable role definitions allow for precise control over user permissions and access within the system.
- **Permission Adjustments**: Intuitive interfaces for adjusting permissions in real-time, supporting dynamic business environments.

## Security Measures

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures that users can only access information and perform actions relevant to their roles.
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized data breaches.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Ongoing reviews and updates to security protocols to guard against new vulnerabilities.

## Performance Considerations

- **Load Balancing**: Implements load balancing to distribute client requests efficiently across multiple servers.
- **Database Indexing**: Extensive use of indexing to speed up query performance on large datasets.
